# 🧠 Multi-Agent Learning System

This is a modular AI-powered learning assistant built using the OpenAI Agents SDK. It combines multiple specialized agents that collaboratively help users plan, retain, and optimize their learning experience.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Learning Architect Agent**: Designs personalized, evidence-based study plans.
- **Memory & Recall Agent**: Creates flashcards, spaced repetition schedules, and recall strategies.
- **Cognitive Coach Agent**: Supports focus, productivity, and metacognitive development.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/multi-agent-learning.git
cd multi-agent-learning
```
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3.10+ and the OpenAI Agents SDK installed:

```bash
pip install openai-agents
```

### 3. Run the System

```bash
python main.py
```

You’ll be prompted to choose an agent to start with. Each agent will guide you through a conversation to help with your learning goals.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
├── main.py                # Entry point, handles routing and session flow
├── context.py             # Shared learner profile structure
├── tools/learner_tools.py # (Optional) agent tools that use the profile
├── agents/
│   ├── architect.py       # Learning Architect Agent
│   ├── memory.py          # Memory & Recall Agent
│   └── cognitive.py       # Cognitive Coach Agent
└── outputs/               # Saved markdown files from each session
```

---

## 📄 Output

Each session creates a timestamped folder in `outputs/` containing:

- `learning_architect_agent.md`
- `memory_&_recall_agent.md`
- `cognitive_coach_agent.md` _(if invoked)_
- `index.md`: A summary index linking all outputs

---

## 🧠 Example Usage

```text
> Which agent would you like to use? architect/memory/cognitive

🧠 Starting with the Learning Architect Agent...
This agent will help you create a personalized study plan.
You might say: “I’m preparing for the MCAT in 3 months. Build a study plan for me.”

...

📌 Insight: You mentioned having difficulty focusing.
The system is automatically engaging the Cognitive Coach Agent to support your concentration.
```

---

## 🔄 Agent Interoperability

Agents share a common `LearnerProfile` context, allowing them to:

- Diagnose issues from prior agent outputs
- Pass on goals, preferences, and learning challenges
- Coordinate interventions across planning, recall, and focus

---

## 🧪 Extending the System

To add a new agent:

1. Create a new file in `agents/`.
2. Define your `Agent[LearnerProfile]` with an `output_type`.
3. Update `main.py` to include the new agent in the routing logic.
