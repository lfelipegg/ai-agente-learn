# Memory & Recall Agent

Certainly! Here are some exercises tailored to each topic:

### **Weeks 1-2: Introduction to Variables and Basic Operations**

1. **Variable Identification:**
   - Identify the variables in the following expression: \(2x + 5 = 13\)
   - If \(x = 3\), calculate the value of \(2x + 8\).

2. **Basic Operations with Variables:**
   - Simplify \(3x + 4x - 2x\).
   - Calculate \((5x - 3) + (2x + 7)\).

### **Weeks 3-4: Solving Simple Equations**

3. **Equation Solving:**
   - Solve for \(x\): \(x + 7 = 12\).
   - Solve for \(y\): \(3y - 4 = 2y + 5\).

4. **Real-life Problem Solving:**
   - Sarah has \(x\) apples, buys 5 more, and then gives 3 to a friend. If she has 10 now, how many did she start with?

### **Weeks 5-6: Advanced Equations and Inequalities**

5. **Multi-step Equations:**
   - Solve for \(x\): \(5(x - 2) = 3x + 4\).
   - Solve for \(z\): \(2(z + 3) - 3(z - 2) = 9\).

6. **Inequalities:**
   - Solve and graph \(4x + 5 > 13\).
   - Solve the inequality \(x - 3 < 2x + 4\) and express the solution.

### **Weeks 7-8: Application of Algebra in Real-world Problems**

7. **Professional Scenarios:**
   - As a project manager, you set a project length as \(d\) days. If the project is currently 5 days behind schedule, express and solve the equation for a new total project duration if 8 additional days are required.

8. **Create Your Own Problem:**
   - Think about a situation in your work that involves counting or budgeting. Formulate the scenario as an algebraic equation and solve it.

### **Review and Reflection**

- Spend some time each week reflecting on which exercises were challenging and why. Use this reflection to seek additional practice in those areas.

This set of exercises aims to build your understanding progressively and provide real-world context for algebraic concepts. Enjoy your learning journey!
